# -MVC--Challenge-Tech-Blog-14


## Description


- To build a fully functioning tech blog that allowed for reading and writing posts.
- I build this so I can have a area specifically dedicated to technology where other members of the community can come together and share knowledge.
- It solved the issue of having to read from several blogs or websites to get the answer to a question you need.
- I learned how to use handlebars to accomplish this task!
